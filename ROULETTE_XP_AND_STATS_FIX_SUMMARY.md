# Roulette XP and Stats Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **XP Awarded Immediately on Bet Placement (CRITICAL BUG)**
**Problem**: XP was being awarded immediately when users placed bets, which is incorrect behavior.
**Solution**: 
- Removed `add_xp_for_wager()` function that was called during bet placement
- Removed `process_roulette_bet_complete()` function that awarded XP immediately
- XP is now only awarded when rounds complete via `complete_roulette_round()` function
- Updated frontend to remove immediate XP refresh calls

### 2. **Roulette Stats Not Being Updated**
**Problem**: Roulette statistics (wins, losses, total bets, etc.) were not being properly tracked.
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `complete_roulette_round()` function that updates all stats
- Ensures all stats are updated in `user_level_stats` table when rounds complete
- Tracks: `roulette_games`, `roulette_wins`, `roulette_wagered`, `roulette_profit`
- Also updates global stats: `total_games`, `total_wins`, `total_wagered`, `total_profit`

### 3. **Database Security Issue (SECURITY DEFINER)**
**Problem**: `user_profile_view` was defined with `SECURITY DEFINER`, which is a security risk.
**Solution**:
- Dropped and recreated the view without `SECURITY DEFINER`
- View now properly respects user permissions and RLS policies
- Maintains all functionality while improving security

### 4. **Inconsistent Table Usage**
**Problem**: Some functions were trying to access XP/stats from `profiles` table instead of `user_level_stats`.
**Solution**:
- All XP and stats functions now exclusively use `user_level_stats` table
- `profiles` table only handles balance and basic user info
- `user_level_stats` table is the single source of truth for all game statistics

## New Functions Created

### 1. `place_roulette_bet(p_user_id, p_round_id, p_bet_color, p_bet_amount)`
- **Purpose**: Handle bet placement (NO XP/STATS)
- **What it does**:
  - Validates round status and user balance
  - Deducts balance from `profiles` table
  - Creates bet record in `roulette_bets` table
  - Returns bet ID and potential payout
- **When called**: When user places a bet

### 2. `complete_roulette_round(p_round_id)`
- **Purpose**: Handle round completion (XP + STATS)
- **What it does**:
  - Processes all bets in the round
  - Awards XP for wagers (1 XP per $1 wagered)
  - Updates all roulette statistics
  - Handles level-ups and notifications
  - Pays out winnings to profiles table
  - Marks round as completed
- **When called**: When round ends and result is determined

### 3. `calculate_level_from_xp_new(p_xp)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate level from XP amount
- **What it does**:
  - Calculates current level based on XP
  - Returns level, current level XP, and XP needed for next level
- **Used by**: `complete_roulette_round()` for level calculations

## Updated Components

### 1. **Roulette Engine Edge Function**
- Updated `placeBet()` function to use `place_roulette_bet()` RPC
- Updated `completeRound()` function to use `complete_roulette_round()` RPC
- Removed all immediate XP awarding logic
- Simplified bet processing flow

### 2. **Frontend RouletteGame Component**
- Removed immediate XP refresh calls after bet placement
- XP is now only refreshed when rounds complete
- Maintains all existing UI functionality

### 3. **Database Schema**
- Ensured `user_level_stats` table has all required columns
- Fixed `user_profile_view` security issue
- Proper permissions granted to all new functions

## Migration Files

### 1. `20250130000050_fix-roulette-xp-and-stats-complete.sql`
- Comprehensive migration that applies all fixes
- Creates new functions and updates existing ones
- Includes verification steps

### 2. `fix-roulette-xp-and-stats-complete.sql`
- Standalone fix file for manual application
- Same content as migration but can be run independently

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. **Bet Placement Test**
- Place a bet and verify:
  - Balance is deducted immediately
  - No XP is awarded
  - Bet appears in `roulette_bets` table
  - Live feed shows bet as "pending"

### 2. **Round Completion Test**
- Wait for round to complete and verify:
  - XP is awarded for the wager
  - Roulette stats are updated
  - Winners receive payouts
  - Live feed shows final results

### 3. **Level Up Test**
- Place bets that will trigger level up and verify:
  - Level increases correctly
  - Cases are awarded
  - Notification is created
  - XP calculations are accurate

### 4. **Security Test**
- Verify `user_profile_view` no longer has SECURITY DEFINER
- Test that RLS policies work correctly
- Ensure users can only see their own data

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the following can be used to rollback:

1. **Restore old functions**:
   ```sql
   -- Restore add_xp_for_wager function
   -- Restore process_roulette_bet_complete function
   ```

2. **Revert roulette engine**:
   - Restore previous version of `placeBet()` and `completeRound()` functions
   - Remove calls to new RPC functions

3. **Restore frontend**:
   - Add back immediate XP refresh calls in RouletteGame component

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- Reduced database load during bet placement (no immediate XP/stat updates)
- Better transaction handling with dedicated functions
- Improved security with proper view permissions

### Monitoring Points:
- Round completion processing time (now handles all bets in one transaction)
- XP calculation performance during level-ups
- Live feed update frequency

## Future Considerations

1. **Batch Processing**: Consider batching XP awards for high-volume scenarios
2. **Caching**: Implement caching for level calculations to improve performance
3. **Monitoring**: Add metrics to track XP award rates and level-up frequency
4. **Audit Trail**: Consider adding more detailed audit logs for XP and stat changes

## Summary

This comprehensive fix resolves all the critical issues with roulette XP and stats tracking:

✅ **XP is now only awarded when rounds complete** (not on bet placement)  
✅ **Roulette stats are properly updated** in the correct table  
✅ **Database security issue is resolved** (SECURITY DEFINER removed)  
✅ **All functions use the correct tables** (user_level_stats for stats, profiles for balance)  
✅ **System is more secure and performant** with proper separation of concerns  

The fix maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving the system's reliability and security.
